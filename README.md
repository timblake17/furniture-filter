## React Furniture Filters With JSON file and Github API

### Summary
##### I used React to build this In separate reusable components. I built a Component that uses fetch to call from GitHubs Api and passes my username in as a property. If API call is successful I get a response and chose to display my Github Profile Picture, My company, and My summary. If call is not successful there will be an error message displayed.

##### In my next furniture filter component I built a separate JSON file that has an array of objects containing data including about 15 pieces of furniture that I found from Wayfair. Each object contains the furniture title, price, an image link, a link to where the user can purchase the furniture, and the furniture type. I created the filter based on the furniture type where the user can view either couch, table, recliner, chair, and a default featured state that will be viewed if no furniture filter is selected. It works by pushing the type into a state array and will only view that type of furniture if that particular type is in the state array.

### What I Learned
#### More familiarity with calling data from api's using fetch, How to map through a whole JSON file and filtering certain objects to show by changing the state of my component, and some good lessons on refactoring code structure for cleaner code and efficiency.
